## 🛡️ Anti-Virus False Positive Note

Hey there, just a heads up! 😊

Our program uses a public hook to render the menu in-game. This is totally normal, but some anti-virus software might get a bit nervous and flag it as a potentially unwanted program (PUP) or even malware. Don't worry, our mod isn't here to cause trouble! 

To keep your anti-virus software calm and let the mod work its magic, you should add an exception for it in your anti-virus software. This tells your anti-virus that our mod is a friend, not a foe. 🤝

Enjoy gaming without any unnecessary interruptions! 🎮
